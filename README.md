# Propositional-Formula-Checker

Part of COMP0009 coursework. This program checks whether a formula is a proposition, a negation, or a binary. If it's a binary, it will also check whether the formula is satisfiable or not.

The program checks up to **10 formulas**, each formula has a max length of **50 characters**. This can be adjusted in lines **5** and **6** in ``skeleton_tab.c``.

## How to use:
1. Create a file named ``input.txt``
2. Write down your propositional formulas, each formula must be written on a separate line. An example file is included in the repo.
3. Compile the program, for example ``gcc skeleton_tab.c -o skeleton_tab``
4. Run the program, for example ``./skeleton_tab``
5. Output with the filename ``output.txt`` will be created.
